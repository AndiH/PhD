Stuff for my PhD Thesis

## Bibliography
LaTeX bibliography files I'm using in my thesis

## Graphics
The plots and graphs and other visualizations I've done for my thesis and talks

## Programming
Scripts and other small code snippets for programming. Easiest way to use them: Place `.rootrc` in your home directory, modify path to match location of the `common.cpp` and you're done. ROOT will include the file automatically from now on. The documentation for `common.cpp` is located at [http://andih.github.io/PhD/](http://andih.github.io/PhD/).

Located in `root-aliases.sh`, my collection of ROOT shell aliases, making your life a little easier.

While we're speaking of it: A neat little shortcut to directly search for a class (etc.) on ROOT's website is the following search phrase:

```
http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aroot.cern.ch%2Froot%2Fhtml+-site%3Aroot.cern.ch%2Froot%2Fhtml%2Fsrc%2F+-site%3Aroot.cern.ch%2Froot%2Fhtml%2Fexamples%2F+%s&btnI=745
```

Just save it with a short key (I recommend `r`) as a [custom search engine](chrome://settings/searchEngines), invoke it, and go to your favorite class description.
