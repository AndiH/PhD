	Abstract = {Recently iterative procedures have been proposed for track and vertex fitting in counter experiments. We show that the proper theoretical framework for these procedures is the theory of linear filtering, in particular the Kalman filter. Using results from filtering theory we confirm and extend the previous results. We also discuss the detection of outliers and of secondary vertices. },

@article{tracking:genfit,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for track fitting which is usable in a wide range of experiments, independent of the specific event topology, detector setup, or magnetic field arrangement. This goal is achieved through a completely modular design. Fitting algorithms are implemented as interchangeable modules. At present, the framework contains a validated Kalman filter. Track parameterizations and the routines required to extrapolate the track parameters and their covariance matrices through the experiment are also implemented as interchangeable modules. Different track parameterizations and extrapolation routines can be used simultaneously for fitting of the same physical track. Representations of detector hits are the third modular ingredient to the framework. The hit dimensionality and orientation of planar tracking detectors are not restricted. Tracking information from detectors which do not measure the passage of particles in a fixed physical detector plane, e.g. drift chambers or TPCs, is used without any simplification. The concept is implemented in a light-weight C++ library called GENFIT, which is available as free software. },

@article{tracking:kisel_kalman_simd,
	Abstract = {Modern high energy physics experiments have to process terabytes of input data produced in particle collisions. The core of many data reconstruction algorithms in high energy physics is the Kalman filter. Therefore, the speed of Kalman filter based algorithms is of crucial importance in on-line data processing. This is especially true for the combinatorial track finding stage where the Kalman filter based track fit is used very intensively. Therefore, developing fast reconstruction algorithms, which use maximum available power of processors, is important, in particular for the initial selection of events which carry signals of interesting physics. One of such powerful feature supported by almost all up-to-date \{PC\} processors is a \{SIMD\} instruction set, which allows packing several data items in one register and to operate on all of them, thus achieving more operations per clock cycle. The novel Cell processor extends the parallelization further by combining a general-purpose PowerPC processor core with eight streamlined coprocessing elements which greatly accelerate vector processing applications. In the investigation described here, after a significant memory optimization and a comprehensive numerical analysis, the Kalman filter based track fitting algorithm of the \{CBM\} experiment has been vectorized using inline operator overloading. Thus the algorithm continues to be flexible with respect to any \{CPU\} family used for data reconstruction. Because of all these changes the \{SIMDized\} Kalman filter based track fitting algorithm takes 1 Î¼s per track that is 10000 times faster than the initial version. Porting the algorithm to a Cell Blade computer gives another factor of 10 of the speedup. Finally, we compare performance of the tracking algorithm running on three different \{CPU\} architectures: Intel Xeon, \{AMD\} Opteron and Cell Broadband Engine. },
