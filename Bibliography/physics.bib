@article{physics:dkpipi:focus,
	Abstract = {Using data collected by the high-energy photoproduction experiment \{FOCUS\} at Fermilab we performed a Dalitz plot analysis of the Cabibbo favored decay D + → K − π + π + . This study uses 53653 Dalitz-plot events with a signal fraction of ∼ 97 % , and represents the highest statistics, most complete Dalitz plot analysis for this channel. Results are presented and discussed using two different formalisms. The first is a simple sum of Breit--Wigner functions with freely fitted masses and widths. It is the model traditionally adopted and serves as comparison with the already published analyses. The second uses a K-matrix approach for the dominant S-wave, in which the parameters are fixed by first fitting Kπ scattering data and continued to threshold by Chiral Perturbation Theory. We show that the Dalitz plot distribution for this decay is consistent with the assumption of two-body dominance of the final state interactions and the description of these interactions is in agreement with other data on the Kπ final state. },

@article{physics:higgs:atlas,
	Abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton--proton collisions with the \{ATLAS\} detector at the \{LHC\} is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H → Z Z ( ⁎ ) → 4 ℓ , H → γ γ and H → W W ( ⁎ ) → e ν μ ν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H → Z Z ( ⁎ ) , W W ( ⁎ ) , b b ¯ and τ + τ − in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H → Z Z ( ⁎ ) → 4 ℓ and H → γ γ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 $\pm$ 0.4 ( stat ) $\pm$ 0.4 ( sys )   GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7 × 10 − 9 , is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson. },
